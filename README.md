# ClockfacePomeranianFitBit 
Versa 2 , Version 4.3

A space dog clock that is interactive and changes based on day, night, and stats. 
The art was created by me using Vectornator, which is a svg art program on IPAD. 
The art already existed from another project - ABC Pup for Android App, so I just 
resized a snapshot of a scene to a 300 x 300 pixel area. This watch is private only
in the Fitbit Studio. The animations are triggered by movement instead of time giving
it a choppy look that isn't very user friendly. See my Animate codes using transform,
sprites, and time for better examples. Also Morse Code Game uses the same art. The one 
benefit to animating only upon movement is that it saves battery.

You can see more of my art at https://www.instagram.com/puppyvector/?hl=en. 

Adds a png background, time, steps, battery life. 
Updates every second (unfortunately this is the most accurate Fitbit can get without draining battery).

Cute Background keeps stats and changes based off of the time of day to reflect day and night. 
Dog jumps and moves if you move the watch - which is my design using the accel functions to update animation.

The dog also updates on different events -  like after 10 PM , it sleeps. Then changes positions 2 times.
