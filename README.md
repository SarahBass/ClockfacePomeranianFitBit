# ClockfacePomeranianFitBit
Versa 2 , Version 4.3

Adds a png background, time, steps, battery life. 
Updates every second (unfortunately this is the most accurate Fitbit can get)

Hope to add an animated screen and buttons, but the clockface is very limited in it's ability. 

*This is my desired result, but the clock is not yet ready:*

It should open up animations, however, this would be better suited for the app rather than the clockface. 
A clockface can only show animations and maybe have a click event unlike apps which are more suitable for games.
