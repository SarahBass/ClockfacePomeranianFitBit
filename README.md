# ClockfacePomeranianFitBit - Still under design changes
Versa 2 , Version 4.3

A space dog clock that is interactive and changes based on day, night, and stats. 
The art was created by me using Vectornator, which is a svg art program on IPAD. 
The art already existed from another project - ABC Pup for Android App, so I just 
resized a snapshot of a scene to a 300 x 300 pixel area. 

You can see more of my art at https://www.instagram.com/puppyvector/?hl=en although I have to say, 
most people are not a fan of the designs, but hey- I'm not an artist! Give me a break. 


Adds a png background, time, steps, battery life. 
Updates every second (unfortunately this is the most accurate Fitbit can get without draining battery).

Cute Background keeps stats and changes based off of the time of day to reflect day and night. 
Dog jumps and moves if you move the watch - which is my design using the accel functions to update animation.
